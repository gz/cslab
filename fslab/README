./fstest issues a series of operations (open, read, write, ...) on the
specified FAT image. The commands are read from a command file
(image.img.command) and have the following syntax:

File        := { CommandLine }.
CommandLine := { Command ID ' ' Argument }.
Command     := 'o'|'c'|'r'.
ID          := '0'|...|'9'.
Argument    := FileName

Commands:
o: open 'Argument'
c: close
r: read 'Argument' bytes 


Examples:

* 'o1 FILE.TXT' opens file FILE.TXT with and assigns the file descriptor 1
* 'r1 1000' reads 1000 bytes from file descriptor 1
