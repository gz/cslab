Traces:
=======

 1 deadlock     deadlock: simulation should not finish
 2 priority-1   process 1 should run first
 3 priority-2   process 0 should run until process 1 starts
 4 priority-3   process 0 should run until process 1 starts and after 1 renices
                (after 2 slots)
 5 inversion    - standard: 0 runs and locks 0, 1 runs tries to lock 0 and waits,
                  1 starts and preempts 0
                - priority inheritance:  0 runs and locks 0, 1 runs and tries to
                  lock 0 and waits (at this point process 0 should be reniced to
                  the same priority as process 1), 1 starts but waits for 0 and
                  1 to finish
 6 random-1    random trace 10 processes
 7 random-2    random trace 100 processes
 8 random-3    random trace 1000 processes
 9 random-4    random tracd 10 short processes
10 length      1 long process 9 short processes
11 idle        idle CPU
